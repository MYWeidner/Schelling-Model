2D torus model

### Intro

In this make believe world there are two distinct groups of people, and they do not get along. These two groups are Winter sports fans and Summer sports fans. Both groups think that their seasonal sports are the best, and they constantly argue with one another. They have collectively decided that the best plan of action is to move around so that everyone has some neighbors that like the same sports as they do. In this assignment, I simulated a torus model that represents the world described.

### Scenarios

* Scenario 1: Every home has to have at least 4 or more neighbors that are the same as them.

* Scenario 2: Every home has to have between 1 and 4 (inclusive) neigbors that are the same as them.

* Scenario 3: The third scenario adds a third neighbor that likes BOTH winter and summer sports. These neighbors are sufficent for both summer sport neighbors and winter sport neihbors. In this scenario I still make sure every home has at least 4 like minded neighbors.
